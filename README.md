# Fractal renderer

This was a fun but brief project I worked on.

Most of the functionallity is implemented.
If you have any ideas regarding colouring and general performance, please reach out.
I'd also ultimately like to render this on the GPU.

Rendering the Mandelbrot set at 1,000,000x zoom.

It took my shitty laptop ~1 second to render the 3000x3000 image above. And that's on the CPU!
